My Fonts
=====

All the fonts I use and I need to keep.

## How to install (Mac)

Clone the repository or download the zipball.

To install all the font you need to copy them to ~/Library/Fonts. Use the following commands
 
```bash
find ~/Projects/fonts/ -name "*.ttf" -exec cp -iv {} ~/Library/Fonts \;
```

```bash
find ~/Projects/fonts/ -name "*.otf" -exec cp -iv {} /Library/Fonts \;
```

This is how to use it on a Mac, I'm sure you can figure out how to do it on your *nix OS.
